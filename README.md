### About this Project 

Developed as part of the graduate course DAT 530: Present and Visualize Data at Southern New Hampshire University, this project focused on designing data visualizations tailored to diverse audiences within a state government context. Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard alongside two additional deliverables: a PowerPoint presentation and a public-facing pamphlet.

Project Scenario:
As a "contracted data analyst", I was tasked with developing three data visualization solutions for a state government (selected Pennsylvania from available source data):
- Storm Activity Presentation: Created a PowerPoint for the state budget office to support the establishment of a monetary reserve and guide the allocation of emergency resources to high-risk areas.
- Interactive Dashboard: Designed a dynamic dashboard for the Emergency Management Agency (EMA) to assess storm damage, allocate emergency equipment, and respond to media inquiries. 
- Public Safety Pamphlet: Developed a visually engaging pamphlet to educate the public on storm preparedness, featuring key statistics and safety recommendations.

This project emphasized effective communication through data visualization, adapting technical insights for decision-makers, operational teams, and the general public.
